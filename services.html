          <p class="lead">
            MAD Obsidian Consulting is a creator marketing consultant studio delivering
            practical marketing systems for small teams. We focus on content systems,
            website optimization, and light paid ads that fit your calendar and budget.
            Every engagement includes collaborative sessions, clean docs, and a handoff
            you can actually use. We work with creators, solopreneurs, and small
            business marketing leads who want proactive guidance without a bloated
            retainer. Expect clear timelines, weekly check-ins, and specific
            recommendations rather than generic decks. Everything is scoped to run on
            the tools you already know.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            We sequence projects so you get quick wins first—refresh the offer, clean
            up analytics, then layer in campaigns—before moving into ongoing support.

                <h3>Content System Setup for Creators</h3>
                <p>
                  We act as your creator marketing consultant to design a weekly
                  publishing rhythm that survives real life. We analyze what’s already
                  resonating, define content pillars, and build templates for scripts,
                  captions, and thumbnails. Small dashboards show saves, replies, and
                  clicks so you know what to repeat. These are content systems you can
                  delegate or run yourself without adding another platform to babysit.
                </p>

                <h3>Website & Landing Page Design</h3>
                <p>
                  Your website should make it obvious what you offer and how to book. We
                  craft focused landing pages and mini-sites with sharp copy, offer
                  stacks, and lead capture. Website optimization comes standard:
                  metadata, search-friendly structure, analytics, and basic speed
                  checks. Each handoff includes a Loom walkthrough so small business
                  marketing teams can edit confidently between launches.

                <h3>Paid Ads Setup & Light Management (Meta, TikTok, Google)</h3>
                <p>
                  We set up paid ads that support your organic content instead of
                  replacing it. That means clean tracking, sensible campaign structures,
                  and weekly creative swaps across Meta, TikTok, or Google. We stay
                  honest about results—no growth promises—while giving you tidy reports,
                  budget views, and a simple testing plan. It’s a light management layer
                  that plugs into your existing marketing systems.

                <h3>Brand Messaging & Positioning</h3>
                <p>
                  Brand consulting should clarify, not complicate. We run collaborative
                  workshops to capture audience language, outline proof points, and
                  decide what you stand for. From there we write messaging pillars,
                  headlines, and social bios that keep your content strategy and website
                  consistent. Everything is documented so future scripts, emails, and
                  ads start from the same voice.
                </p>

                <h3>Simple Funnel & Lead Capture Systems</h3>
                <p>
                  Funnels don’t have to be complex to work. We map the path from your
                  content systems to a booking link or purchase page, then wire forms,
                  tags, and follow-ups through tools you already use. Simple automation
                  keeps leads organized while letting you reply with personality. Each
                  build leaves room for future website optimization or paid traffic
                  without rebuilding the stack.
