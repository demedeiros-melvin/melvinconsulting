          <p class="lead">
            MAD Obsidian Consulting builds content and marketing systems for creators, founders, and teams who need clear direction without heavy retainers. As a creator marketing consultant, we map the plays that matter: website optimization, launch readiness, and momentum with light paid media. Every project is scoped to fit a lean crew so you can own the process after we hand off.

                <h3>Content System Setup for Creators</h3>
                <p>
                  Every creator marketing consultant engagement starts with mapping a repeatable content system you can run without a big team. We audit your current channels, clarify themes, and build templates that keep your videos, emails, and posts consistent. We also connect a light reporting loop so you can see what drives saves and replies. The result: content systems that fit your schedule and give you a roadmap for experiments, not just more ideas in a doc.

                <p>
                  Creators and small business marketing teams need pages that convert and can be updated fast. We design simple landing pages or small websites with clean hierarchy, direct copy, and clear CTAs. Each build includes website optimization basics—metadata, load-speed considerations, and analytics hooks—plus a short Loom walkthrough so you can self-edit. Expect a modern, on-brand experience that supports your launch, offer, or booking flow.

                <p>
                  As a small business marketing consultant, we set up lean ad foundations on Meta, TikTok, or Google without long-term retainers. We handle pixel and conversion tracking, build test-ready campaigns, and outline rotating creative ideas. Our light management focuses on weekly checks, budget pacing, and tidy reports so you know what’s working without heavy dashboards. It plugs into your broader marketing systems instead of running as a silo.

                <p>
                  Clear positioning keeps your content strategy and website coherent. We host a collaborative workshop to distill your offer, audience language, and proof. Then we create messaging pillars, headlines, and social bios so every channel feels aligned. Think of it as brand consulting for creators and founders who want confident copy without jargon-heavy decks. The output is built to snap into your marketing systems and future scripts.

                <h3>Simple Funnel & Lead Capture Systems</h3>
                <p>
                  We map a straightforward funnel that pairs your content systems with lead capture and follow-up. That includes landing page flow, form design, and connecting tools like Calendly, ConvertKit, or HubSpot. Automations stay simple: tags, confirmations, and reminders that keep you organized without bloat. For creators and small business marketing teams, this keeps prospects moving from post to booked call while leaving room for future website optimization and paid traffic.

            <p>
              We exist to help early-stage creators, founders, and small businesses
              build sustainable marketing systems through content, websites, and
              light automation. That means simplifying offers, aligning messaging
              across socials and landing pages, and making sure every new asset is
              easy to maintain. We work inside your stack—Notion, Squarespace,
              Webflow, Google Analytics, or your email platform—so nothing sits
              unused. Deliverables are tight, documented, and designed for lean
              teams who want clarity more than complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
              We keep each engagement collaborative and transparent, and we’re
